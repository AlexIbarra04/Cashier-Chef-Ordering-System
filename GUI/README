*Name*
Cashier-Chef Ordering System (CCOS)

*Introduction*
The system provides a method of ordering on a restaurant, where the client goes to the cashier and he orders its food. The cashier selects 
the food ordered by the customer and when the cashier selects that the order was paid, the order is sent to the chef. The chef will have a PC displaying
a queue of the orders. The chef will then be able to click/touch on any order number, see its content and selects it as complete, in which case, the order
will dissapear from the queue.
